          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <p>Everyday People is a nonprofit organization founded and operated by a group of high school students. All 40 of our volunteers have a passion for helping people, and making our state the best that it can be.</p>

          <h2>Why do we exist?</h2>
          <p>Everyday People was created in the aftermath of the Minneapolis protests. We have seen many citizens struggling to get by, family-owned businesses destroyed, and little hope left in our city. We want to change that.</p>
